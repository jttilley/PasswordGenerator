# PasswordGenerator

## Web Link

## Objective
When the Generate Password button is pressed, it will ask the user how long they want their password, and if they want lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and/or special characters. Depending on what they choose it will randomly select a string of characters for the password from their choices and display the password on the page.

## What I did
* I created arrays with the seperate character groups. 
* As the user chose character groups I added them to a final array of characters.
* Then I randomly selected characters from that final array to make up the password to the specified length.
